DESCRIPTION : The AR/VR interface design created for Task-4 of the internship focuses on building an intuitive and interactive user interface for an AR-integrated shopping platform. The objective was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design that enhances the virtual shopping experience by allowing users to interact with products in an immersive way. The Miami Sneakers product was chosen for this interface, and various UI components were implemented to provide a seamless shopping experience. The navigation bar at the top includes three categories: Men, Women, and Kids, along with a search icon and a shopping cart to ensure ease of access. The selected category (Men) is highlighted to indicate the active state, making navigation clear for the user. Below the navigation bar, a promotional banner displays offers and discounts, improving user engagement. The main product display section is designed with a blurred background and a central focus on the sneakers, simulating an AR effect by making the product appear more prominent. Users can scroll through multiple product images in the image carousel, which provides different perspectives of the sneakers. A "View in AR" button is placed near the product, designed with a subtle blinking animation, making it visually appealing and inviting users to interact with the AR feature. This feature helps simulate real-time augmented reality product visualization, which enhances the online shopping experience. The bottom navigation bar includes Home, Wishlist, Categories, Be Exclusive, and Profile icons, ensuring that users can navigate through different sections effortlessly. To maintain consistency and clarity, the Home button is highlighted in red, indicating its active status. Additional UI effects such as drop shadows, hover highlights, and button interactions were used to create an engaging and intuitive design. The prototype link of the interface, if applicable, would demonstrate how users interact with the design in real-time. This includes features like menu navigation, button highlights, and animation effects, which were carefully implemented to maintain a smooth flow of user interactions. A project summary document will also be included as a deliverable, detailing the objectives, tools used, design decisions, and challenges faced during the UI creation process. The document will explain how Figma was used to build the interface, manage layers, apply interactions, and fine-tune UI elements. Some of the challenges encountered during the design process included frame selection issues, difficulty in applying interaction effects, and problems with prototype settings. These were resolved by adjusting layer hierarchy, refining component grouping, and carefully managing visibility settings. Since the task primarily focused on UI design rather than development, no coding was required, but a Figma file link will be shared as part of the deliverables to showcase the completed design. The final AR/VR interface successfully meets the requirements outlined in the internship task by providing a structured, intuitive, and visually appealing UI. The design ensures that users experience a seamless and engaging shopping journey with an interactive AR visualization feature. This project serves as a strong foundation for future AR implementations and can be expanded further into a fully functional AR-based shopping platform. By incorporating intuitive interactions, clear product presentation, and structured navigation, the design effectively aligns with modern e-commerce trends, making it a valuable addition to the virtual shopping experience.
